         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAve ye ≈øate ≈øo long at the Stern, and could ye not ≈øteer your Ship aright, but let it ≈øplit again≈øt a Rock? Had ever any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament longer time to learn to do well then ye had? Had ever any Parliament ≈øuch a prize put into their hands as ye? Had ever any Parliamen: ≈øo many Prayers, Tears, and Petitions, as ye had? Had ever any Parliament ≈øo many ≈øignal Te≈øtimonies of Gods free Love, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øo many <hi>victories</hi> both by Land and Sea as you? Did ever a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament make more ≈øhew of Piety and Reality then you did? Did ever Parliament make ≈øo many Prote≈øtations, Covenants, Engagements both to God and Man, to e≈øtabli≈øh Righteou≈øne≈øs, Truth and Equity, as you? And yet this Honourable, long ≈øtanding, victorious, engaging Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if not fal≈øified the tru≈øt repo≈øed in them) they did fru≈øtrate the expectation of the People that had cho≈øen them: and ≈øo at la≈øt came to be laid a≈øide, either by God, or man, or both, and ≈øcarce a tear for them. And why ≈øo? Did ever Parliament promi≈øe more and perform le≈øs? Did ever Parliament ≈øeek greater things for them≈øelves then this? Were I near them, and had the advantage of their Ear, I would whi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a Word of Advice unto them, I would intreat them to read, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly to con≈øider, that portion of Scripture, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. and 27.</p>
            <p>I would further de≈øire them to do as our brother <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8.
<hi>And</hi> Zacheus <hi>≈øtood forth and ≈øaid unto the Lord Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by for god Cavillation,</hi> (or they may ≈øay, Either upon Publick Faith, or fal≈øe Accu≈øation) <hi>I will re≈øtore four-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you take this advice, it may be you may be hid in the day of the Lords Anger, as in
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Oh! let it never be truly ≈øaid of you, that ye Gain while the Nation lo≈øeth; neither let it be ≈øaid of you, that ye have ≈øpent your time in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering your own ne≈øts: But now be willing to let every bird have his own feather, that every man may ≈øit down under his own Vine, and eat
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118528:2"/> his own bread, unle≈øs it be tho≈øe that have been In≈øtruments of our Troubles,</p>
            <p>I tru≈øt I may ≈øay of ≈øome of the late Parliament, as once was ≈øaid of the Church of
<hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 4. <hi>Thou ha≈øt a few Names yet in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their Garments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to the re≈øt of that Hou≈øe, let me tell them, that if they do not lay the≈øe things to heart, but rather comfort them≈øelves in the con≈øideration of any good that they have done; Then I ≈øay unto you, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wi≈ødome knoweth how to u≈øe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d men to good purpo≈øes; and in the end not onely to ca≈øt them off but to puni≈øh them when the world is done. Remember the ≈øtories of <hi>Haman, Iehu,</hi> and
<hi>Saul,</hi> and you will find that in all Ages, ≈øelf-≈øeekers were ≈øelf-lo≈øers, and ≈øelf-de≈øtroyers, <hi>viz. Adam</hi> ≈øought him≈øelf, and lo≈øt him≈øelf;
<hi>Ab≈øalom</hi> ≈øought him≈øelf, and thereby lo≈øt him≈øelf; Who ever ≈øought him≈øelf and pro≈øpered? Who ever continued to ≈øeek him≈øelf, but peri≈øhed?</p>
            <p>If ye ≈øay, we had a ≈øelf-denying Ordinance; I ≈øay, ye had not a ≈øelf-denying heart and principle; (I am ≈øure, for mine own part, I know it to be ≈øo;) Be≈øides, it appears by your endeavouring to make your ≈øelves a perpetual Parliament, that the next might not que≈øtion you: It ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that you had forgoten that next under God, all Power <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> was in the People, and that per≈øons intru≈øted with it as their Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtees: and accordingly it is provided, that ≈øuch Tru≈øtees be Que≈øtioned for betraying, or ill managing their ≈øaid Tru≈øt.</p>
            <p>Some of your Actions do call for ≈øiftings, and the Lord will ≈øearch you (as with candles) and turn your in≈øides outward, that ≈øo ye may give an account of your Steward≈øhip, for ye may be no longer Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; ≈øurely there is ≈øhame written upon ≈øome of your foot≈øteps, who are ≈øtanding in ≈ølippery places. Oh! might ever a Parliament have come off with more Honour then you, if you had but denyed your Natural ≈øelf, Sinfull ≈øelf, and Religious ≈øelf?</p>
            <p>Well, I perceive that a bird hoppeth from tree to tree, ≈øo do the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and riches of this world from man to man: Nay, Honours and Riches are like the Moon and Tide, always changing, increa≈øing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øing; The Moon hath been increa≈øing, and the Tide comming in you (as is humbly conceived) the≈øe eight or ten years: but now the Moon being at full, and the Spring tide at highe≈øt, the Moon is upon decrea≈øing, and the Tide upon returning.</p>
            <p>Well, I ≈øee a man may have enough of the world to ≈øink him, but he can never have enough to ≈øave him; ≈øurely many times the wor≈øt of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118528:3"/> men have mo≈øt of the≈øe outward things, and the be≈øt of men have lea≈øt of the earth and mo≈øt of heaven.</p>
            <p>I find in Scripture-record that a man may be great and Gracele≈øs with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Honourable and Damnable with <hi>Saul,</hi> Rich and mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with <hi>Dives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh<hi>!</hi> I ≈øee, I ≈øee, that one ≈øtorm at ≈øea, one coal of fire, one fal≈øe friend, one unadvi≈øed word, one fal≈øe witne≈øs, may make a Rich man a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and a Pri≈øoner altogether: Surely if this had been con≈øidered, ≈øome things had been reformed which were not. Did you never read <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Now for the oppre≈ø≈øion of the needy, and for the ≈øighs of the poor, I will up ≈øaith the Lord and will ≈øet him at liberty,</hi> &amp;c. and
<hi>P≈øa.</hi> 126. 9. <hi>The Lord keeps the ≈øtanger, he relieveth the fatherle≈øs and widdow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did you not know thar the oppre≈ø≈øions of the poor, which was ≈øo great in the mid≈øt of us, would pull down the Judgments of God upon the heads of them that had power to relieve them, and would not?</p>
            <p>May not many of you hereafter ≈øay, as <hi>Philip</hi> the third of <hi>Spain</hi> (who≈øe life was free from gro≈øs evils) yet being in the Agony of Death, fear ≈øtruck into him, and the≈øe words bur≈øt out, <hi>O would to God I had never Reigned! Oh that I had lived a ≈øolitary life with God, and not oppre≈øt the people! What doth all mine Honour profit me, but that I have ≈øo much the more torment in my Death! the day of my Account is very near.</hi> And let all men know, that the overflowing of Sin, and the overflowing of Oppre≈ø≈øion cau≈øeth the overflowing of Vengeance.</p>

            <p>WHom God even the God of the ≈øpirits of all fle≈øh hath intru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at pre≈øent with the highe≈øt places not onely in the field, but al≈øo in the ≈øeat of Ju≈øtice: the prayers of the Godly for you are; that the Lord would rather make you gracious and inwardly holy, then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly happy; and give you a ≈øpirit of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>vine wi≈ødom and valour, ≈øuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the work in hand, that ye may improve the pre≈øent opportunity that is put into your hands, for the glory of God that gave it you; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider that the pre≈øence of God is in the mid≈øt of you, the prayers of the Saints and ≈øervants of God are continually poured out for you, the eys of the people are upon you all, expecting ≈øome great things to be done by you; yea, and the other parts of the world look upon you (as if they intended) if you go on in any way of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, to follow you; it will be a glory for the Engli≈øh nation to give a ble≈ø≈øed example to all the people of the earth to free them≈øelves from Tyranny and Slavery,</p>
            <p>If a worm might be thought worthy to advi≈øe you, then give me leave to tell you, there is but one thing in the main that God and his people do expect from you, <hi>viz.</hi> that you would eye the Lord Je≈øus in all your actings, and advance his Kingdom as much as in you lies, and if this be uppermo≈øt in your hearts, fir≈øt in your thoughts, and con≈øtant in your purpo≈øes; ≈øo as you do in your judgements prefer, and in your wills deliberately mind the glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdom of his dear ≈øon, by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his holy ≈øpirit, then ≈øhall the work of the Lord pro≈øper in your hands, and the day ≈øhall be light before you, and his foot≈øteps that are not yet known, ≈øhall be di≈øcovered unto you, and ye ≈øhall ≈øee your work before you.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt was once humbled that we might be exalted; let him be now exalted that we may be humbled by him.</p>
            <p>Although he be willing to give you grace, yet his glory he will not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118528:4"/> give to any other: let it be a comfort to you that he hath exalted you in the heart of his people, although you are a table-talk, and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, and a ≈øcorn, in the hearts of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Well, would you ≈øtand your ≈øelves now others are fallen, and not onely keep, but al≈øo add to the honor which God hath given you, then make it your bu≈øine≈øs to exalt the Kingdom of Chri≈øt not onely in your ≈øelves, but al≈øo in the neighbouring nations; and remember that the rock of ages pulleth down ≈øome, to the end that others might not exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves when they are in power; for the Lord hath decreed to ≈øtain the pride of all earthly honour, and to bring into contempt all the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the earth, that ≈øo all fle≈øh might be humbled, and the Lord alone exalted: Therefore ≈øeek you not great things for your ≈øelves (as many of tho≈øe before you did) le≈øt you be al≈øo laid a≈øide, and no eye pity you.</p>
            <p>Provide no more for your ≈øelves then you have (I be≈øeech you) but to ≈øeek the honour of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and the freedom of the Saints, and the≈øe nations, wherein your own freedomes and ≈øafeties are involved: Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord hath hitherto made you friends to ≈øome of his people, and a terror to their and his enemies: and our prayer to the Lord is, that he would teach you, as once he did good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to do many years hard ≈øervice freely, becau≈øe the payments were heavy on their brethren. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 14. 18. That you may ≈øay as that ≈øervant of Chri≈øt did, to the glory of God. and the ≈øhame of the former ≈øelf-≈øeeking powers, <hi>ver.</hi> 15 <hi>but the former Governours that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them their bread and wine, be≈øides</hi> 40 <hi>≈øhekles of ≈øilver, but ≈øo did not I</hi> (≈øaith the good man) <hi>becau≈øe of the fear of the Lord.</hi> I have but a few things more to beg (as upon my bended knees, and with weeping eys) which if you will but hear and grant, it may make much for the glory of God, the honour of the three nations, and the comfort of your own ≈øouls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The fir≈øt thing is, that you would ≈øet ≈øome time and per≈øons apart to hear and receive the private Petitions of poor widows, and fatherle≈øs ≈øo much neglected by the former power; for they have poured out their complaints in the mid≈øt of their wants, and their cry came up before the Lord, before the di≈ø≈øolving the late Parliament.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider (I reque≈øt you) that the earth is the Lords, and all that is therein, (and not our Storehou≈øe) and you are at pre≈øent his Stewards, wherefore as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>With hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> So ≈øhall you in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118528:4"/> the end be able to ≈øay with <hi>Iob, that you have not withhold the poor from their de≈øire, nor cau≈øed the eys of the widow and fatherle≈ø≈øe to ≈øail, nor ≈øeen any peri≈øh for want of cloathing nor ≈øeen any poor in the ≈øtreets without covering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could almo≈øt ≈øay to you, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did once to the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27.
<hi>behold now I have taken upon me to ≈øpeak which am but du≈øt and a≈øhes;</hi> I would beg leave to pre≈øent a few more things to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing is, that when you make inqui≈øition for Wolves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of by Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7, 15. compared with <hi>Acts.</hi> 20 19. <hi>That come to us in≈øheeps cloathing;</hi> that you would not do as the late Parliament did, to ≈øtop the wolves mouth in one town, and let him go and devour in another; if he be adjudged unfit to bite or devour in one place, let him be held as unfit in another, le≈øt you ≈øhould do in effect as they did, put out the fire Canne and ≈øend it to <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> or indeavour to ≈øtop the Plague at <hi>Bristol,</hi> by ≈øending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected per≈øons to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing that I would beg of you for this poor nation, is, that whereas the la≈øt power did promi≈øe much and perform little; be you more like God, (I both humbly and earne≈øtly reque≈øt you) by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øing le≈øs then you intend to perform; that you may in very deed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be like him: He promi≈øed the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> onely the land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> but be≈øides that he gave them two other Kingdomes, which he did never promi≈øe to give them<hi>:</hi> and to <hi>Zacharias, Luk.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>he promi≈øed to give him his ≈øpeech again at the birth of the child, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides that he gave him the ≈øpirit of Prophecy;</hi> ≈øo that as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>he cau do abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you that ≈øay ye abide in him, ought ≈øo to walk, as ye have him for an example; ≈øee
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next thing that I would beg of you, Mo≈øt Honorable Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, is this, that you would indeavour to unite all the Saints ≈øound in the faith to an union in the ≈øpirit of love. Though <hi>England</hi> be but as a garden to the whole world, and the people in it but a handfull<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ≈øcarce one of twenty of this handfull Godly men; yet were the≈øe few Saints united by the ble≈ø≈øed ≈øpirit, ≈øo as their hearts might agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as touching any thing they ought to ask; and were ≈øo well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lift up one voice and one heart (according to the will of God) they would have the thing they ask for, ≈øo as nothing ≈øhould be too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118528:5"/> hard for them to do; all the world could not ≈øtand before them, nor undermine them, for they would be wi≈øe in the Lords wi≈øedome, and ≈øtrong in him, and in the power of his might: Shall
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> agree? Turks and Pagans? Beares and Lyons agree? Tygers and Wolves agree? and ≈øhall not Saints agree? if the Saints were but but once united, Antichri≈øt would ≈øoon be de≈øtroyed. Oh! let not our Supream power, under God, be angry, and I will ≈øpeak but this once. Oh! let me then ≈øay as once <hi>Mordecai</hi> did to <hi>He≈øter. Hester</hi> 4.
14. <hi>If thou altogether holde≈øt thy peace at this time, then ≈øhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ari≈øe from another place, or power, but thou and thy fathers hou≈øe ≈øhall be destroyed, and who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdome for ≈øuch a time as this?</hi> (And under Correction) let me tell you the work is the Lords, and if you will not carry it on, he will lay you a≈øide with ≈øhame, and rai≈øe up tho≈øe that he will own and ble≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>And whereas mo≈øt of the Godly people in <hi>England,</hi> are crying to God mightly for you, to purge out ≈øelf-≈øeeking, and to plant a ≈øpirit of government in you, and to furni≈øh you with natural and ≈øpiritual abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ≈øuitable to the work that lieth before you; but if you begin to flag (as the former power did) and ≈øo let the work ≈øtick in the birth, and every one minding his own things, and not the things of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Then let me tell you, that all the Lords people in <hi>England,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, will be praying to him, and wre≈øtling with him, and give him no re≈øt night nor day till the Lord turn you al≈øo out of doors, and bring in tho≈øe that he will own and ble≈ø≈øe.</p>
