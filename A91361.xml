         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A WORD to the Diſcontentd MEMBERS of the late</hi> PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>HAve ye ſate ſo long at the Stern, and could ye not ſteer your Ship aright, but let it ſplit againſt a Rock? Had ever any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament longer time to learn to do well then ye had? Had ever any Parliament ſuch a prize put into their hands as ye? Had ever any Parliamen: ſo many Prayers, Tears, and Petitions, as ye had? Had ever any Parliament ſo many ſignal Teſtimonies of Gods free Love, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many <hi>victories</hi> both by Land and Sea as you? Did ever a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament make more ſhew of Piety and Reality then you did? Did ever Parliament make ſo many Proteſtations, Covenants, Engagements both to God and Man, to eſtabliſh Righteouſneſs, Truth and Equity, as you? And yet this Honourable, long ſtanding, victorious, engaging Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (if not falſified the truſt repoſed in them) they did fruſtrate the expectation of the People that had choſen them: and ſo at laſt came to be laid aſide, either by God, or man, or both, and ſcarce a tear for them. And why ſo? Did ever Parliament promiſe more and perform leſs? Did ever Parliament ſeek greater things for themſelves then this? Were I near them, and had the advantage of their Ear, I would whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a Word of Advice unto them, I would intreat them to read, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider, that portion of Scripture, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. and 27.</p>
            <p>I would further deſire them to do as our brother <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 8.
<hi>And</hi> Zacheus <hi>ſtood forth and ſaid unto the Lord Behold Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by for god Cavillation,</hi> (or they may ſay, Either upon Publick Faith, or falſe Accuſation) <hi>I will reſtore four-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you take this advice, it may be you may be hid in the day of the Lords Anger, as in
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Oh! let it never be truly ſaid of you, that ye Gain while the Nation loſeth; neither let it be ſaid of you, that ye have ſpent your time in fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering your own neſts: But now be willing to let every bird have his own feather, that every man may ſit down under his own Vine, and eat
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118528:2"/> his own bread, unleſs it be thoſe that have been Inſtruments of our Troubles,</p>
            <p>I truſt I may ſay of ſome of the late Parliament, as once was ſaid of the Church of
<hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names yet in</hi> Sardis <hi>which have not defiled their Garments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to the reſt of that Houſe, let me tell them, that if they do not lay theſe things to heart, but rather comfort themſelves in the conſideration of any good that they have done; Then I ſay unto you, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdome knoweth how to uſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d men to good purpoſes; and in the end not onely to caſt them off but to puniſh them when the world is done. Remember the ſtories of <hi>Haman, Iehu,</hi> and
<hi>Saul,</hi> and you will find that in all Ages, ſelf-ſeekers were ſelf-loſers, and ſelf-deſtroyers, <hi>viz. Adam</hi> ſought himſelf, and loſt himſelf;
<hi>Abſalom</hi> ſought himſelf, and thereby loſt himſelf; Who ever ſought himſelf and proſpered? Who ever continued to ſeek himſelf, but periſhed?</p>
            <p>If ye ſay, we had a ſelf-denying Ordinance; I ſay, ye had not a ſelf-denying heart and principle; (I am ſure, for mine own part, I know it to be ſo;) Beſides, it appears by your endeavouring to make your ſelves a perpetual Parliament, that the next might not queſtion you: It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that you had forgoten that next under God, all Power <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> was in the People, and that perſons intruſted with it as their Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees: and accordingly it is provided, that ſuch Truſtees be Queſtioned for betraying, or ill managing their ſaid Truſt.</p>
            <p>Some of your Actions do call for ſiftings, and the Lord will ſearch you (as with candles) and turn your inſides outward, that ſo ye may give an account of your Stewardſhip, for ye may be no longer Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; ſurely there is ſhame written upon ſome of your footſteps, who are ſtanding in ſlippery places. Oh! might ever a Parliament have come off with more Honour then you, if you had but denyed your Natural ſelf, Sinfull ſelf, and Religious ſelf?</p>
            <p>Well, I perceive that a bird hoppeth from tree to tree, ſo do the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and riches of this world from man to man: Nay, Honours and Riches are like the Moon and Tide, always changing, increaſing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; The Moon hath been increaſing, and the Tide comming in you (as is humbly conceived) theſe eight or ten years: but now the Moon being at full, and the Spring tide at higheſt, the Moon is upon decreaſing, and the Tide upon returning.</p>
            <p>Well, I ſee a man may have enough of the world to ſink him, but he can never have enough to ſave him; ſurely many times the worſt of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118528:3"/> men have moſt of theſe outward things, and the beſt of men have leaſt of the earth and moſt of heaven.</p>
            <p>I find in Scripture-record that a man may be great and Graceleſs with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Honourable and Damnable with <hi>Saul,</hi> Rich and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with <hi>Dives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh<hi>!</hi> I ſee, I ſee, that one ſtorm at ſea, one coal of fire, one falſe friend, one unadviſed word, one falſe witneſs, may make a Rich man a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and a Priſoner altogether: Surely if this had been conſidered, ſome things had been reformed which were not. Did you never read <hi>Pſa.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Now for the oppreſſion of the needy, and for the ſighs of the poor, I will up ſaith the Lord and will ſet him at liberty,</hi> &amp;c. and
<hi>Pſa.</hi> 126. 9. <hi>The Lord keeps the ſtanger, he relieveth the fatherleſs and widdow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did you not know thar the oppreſſions of the poor, which was ſo great in the midſt of us, would pull down the Judgments of God upon the heads of them that had power to relieve them, and would not?</p>
            <p>May not many of you hereafter ſay, as <hi>Philip</hi> the third of <hi>Spain</hi> (whoſe life was free from groſs evils) yet being in the Agony of Death, fear ſtruck into him, and theſe words burſt out, <hi>O would to God I had never Reigned! Oh that I had lived a ſolitary life with God, and not oppreſt the people! What doth all mine Honour profit me, but that I have ſo much the more torment in my Death! the day of my Account is very near.</hi> And let all men know, that the overflowing of Sin, and the overflowing of Oppreſſion cauſeth the overflowing of Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Abuſed Opportunity will moſt certainly turn inro Fury; for Gods long forbearance

            <p>If a worm might be thought worthy to adviſe you, then give me leave to tell you, there is but one thing in the main that God and his people do expect from you, <hi>viz.</hi> that you would eye the Lord Jeſus in all your actings, and advance his Kingdom as much as in you lies, and if this be uppermoſt in your hearts, firſt in your thoughts, and conſtant in your purpoſes; ſo as you do in your judgements prefer, and in your wills deliberately mind the glory of God, the advancement of the Kingdom of his dear ſon, by the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit, then ſhall the work of the Lord proſper in your hands, and the day ſhall be light before you, and his footſteps that are not yet known, ſhall be diſcovered unto you, and ye ſhall ſee your work before you.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was once humbled that we might be exalted; let him be now exalted that we may be humbled by him.</p>
            <p>Although he be willing to give you grace, yet his glory he will not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118528:4"/> give to any other: let it be a comfort to you that he hath exalted you in the heart of his people, although you are a table-talk, and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, and a ſcorn, in the hearts of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Well, would you ſtand your ſelves now others are fallen, and not onely keep, but alſo add to the honor which God hath given you, then make it your buſineſs to exalt the Kingdom of Chriſt not onely in your ſelves, but alſo in the neighbouring nations; and remember that the rock of ages pulleth down ſome, to the end that others might not exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they are in power; for the Lord hath decreed to ſtain the pride of all earthly honour, and to bring into contempt all the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the earth, that ſo all fleſh might be humbled, and the Lord alone exalted: Therefore ſeek you not great things for your ſelves (as many of thoſe before you did) leſt you be alſo laid aſide, and no eye pity you.</p>
            <p>Provide no more for your ſelves then you have (I beſeech you) but to ſeek the honour of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and the freedom of the Saints, and theſe nations, wherein your own freedomes and ſafeties are involved: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Lord hath hitherto made you friends to ſome of his people, and a terror to their and his enemies: and our prayer to the Lord is, that he would teach you, as once he did good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to do many years hard ſervice freely, becauſe the payments were heavy on their brethren. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 14. 18. That you may ſay as that ſervant of Chriſt did, to the glory of God. and the ſhame of the former ſelf-ſeeking powers, <hi>ver.</hi> 15 <hi>but the former Governours that had been before me, were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them their bread and wine, beſides</hi> 40 <hi>ſhekles of ſilver, but ſo did not I</hi> (ſaith the good man) <hi>becauſe of the fear of the Lord.</hi> I have but a few things more to beg (as upon my bended knees, and with weeping eys) which if you will but hear and grant, it may make much for the glory of God, the honour of the three nations, and the comfort of your own ſouls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing is, that you would ſet ſome time and perſons apart to hear and receive the private Petitions of poor widows, and fatherleſs ſo much neglected by the former power; for they have poured out their complaints in the midſt of their wants, and their cry came up before the Lord, before the diſſolving the late Parliament.</p>
            <p>Conſider (I requeſt you) that the earth is the Lords, and all that is therein, (and not our Storehouſe) and you are at preſent his Stewards, wherefore as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>With hold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</hi> So ſhall you in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118528:4"/> the end be able to ſay with <hi>Iob, that you have not withhold the poor from their deſire, nor cauſed the eys of the widow and fatherleſſe to ſail, nor ſeen any periſh for want of cloathing nor ſeen any poor in the ſtreets without covering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could almoſt ſay to you, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did once to the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27.
<hi>behold now I have taken upon me to ſpeak which am but duſt and aſhes;</hi> I would beg leave to preſent a few more things to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing is, that when you make inquiſition for Wolves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7, 15. compared with <hi>Acts.</hi> 20 19. <hi>That come to us inſheeps cloathing;</hi> that you would not do as the late Parliament did, to ſtop the wolves mouth in one town, and let him go and devour in another; if he be adjudged unfit to bite or devour in one place, let him be held as unfit in another, leſt you ſhould do in effect as they did, put out the fire Canne and ſend it to <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> or indeavour to ſtop the Plague at <hi>Bristol,</hi> by ſending the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing that I would beg of you for this poor nation, is, that whereas the laſt power did promiſe much and perform little; be you more like God, (I both humbly and earneſtly requeſt you) by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing leſs then you intend to perform; that you may in very deed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be like him: He promiſed the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely the land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> but beſides that he gave them two other Kingdomes, which he did never promiſe to give them<hi>:</hi> and to <hi>Zacharias, Luk.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>he promiſed to give him his ſpeech again at the birth of the child, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he gave him the ſpirit of Prophecy;</hi> ſo that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he cau do abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you that ſay ye abide in him, ought ſo to walk, as ye have him for an example; ſee
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next thing that I would beg of you, Moſt Honorable Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, is this, that you would indeavour to unite all the Saints ſound in the faith to an union in the ſpirit of love. Though <hi>England</hi> be but as a garden to the whole world, and the people in it but a handfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſcarce one of twenty of this handfull Godly men; yet were theſe few Saints united by the bleſſed ſpirit, ſo as their hearts might agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as touching any thing they ought to ask; and were ſo well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lift up one voice and one heart (according to the will of God) they would have the thing they ask for, ſo as nothing ſhould be too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118528:5"/> hard for them to do; all the world could not ſtand before them, nor undermine them, for they would be wiſe in the Lords wiſedome, and ſtrong in him, and in the power of his might: Shall
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> agree? Turks and Pagans? Beares and Lyons agree? Tygers and Wolves agree? and ſhall not Saints agree? if the Saints were but but once united, Antichriſt would ſoon be deſtroyed. Oh! let not our Supream power, under God, be angry, and I will ſpeak but this once. Oh! let me then ſay as once <hi>Mordecai</hi> did to <hi>Heſter. Hester</hi> 4.
14. <hi>If thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time, then ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ariſe from another place, or power, but thou and thy fathers houſe ſhall be destroyed, and who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdome for ſuch a time as this?</hi> (And under Correction) let me tell you the work is the Lords, and if you will not carry it on, he will lay you aſide with ſhame, and raiſe up thoſe that he will own and bleſſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas moſt of the Godly people in <hi>England,</hi> are crying to God mightly for you, to purge out ſelf-ſeeking, and to plant a ſpirit of government in you, and to furniſh you with natural and ſpiritual abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſuitable to the work that lieth before you; but if you begin to flag (as the former power did) and ſo let the work ſtick in the birth, and every one minding his own things, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt; Then let me tell you, that all the Lords people in <hi>England,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, will be praying to him, and wreſtling with him, and give him no reſt night nor day till the Lord turn you alſo out of doors, and bring in thoſe that he will own and bleſſe.</p>
